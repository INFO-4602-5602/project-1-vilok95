For this project I based a lot of my work off of the tutorial we did in class.

Part 1: This part was very simple. All we had to do was load in the data and call the function
checkDataset. I figured this out by looking at the tutorial and seeing how we imported a 
dataset. 

Part 2: Again, a lot of this was based off of the stuff we did in the tutorial. The main thing I had to change in this vs the tutorial was making sure the x-axis was going in an incremental order.
I did this by going off of what we learned in class and how to acomplish this. 

Part 3: This was very similar to part 2 except this time we are working with a line graph. Again all
of this was based off of my part 2 but there were some parts I just could not figure out on my own. So for the stuff I did not know, I looked to the internet for help and whenever I used something off of the internet, I cited it through the comments in my code.
